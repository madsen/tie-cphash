DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a case preserving but case insensitive hash.
    This means that

        $cphash{KEY}    $cphash{key}
        $cphash{Key}    $cphash{keY}

    all refer to the same entry.  Also, the hash remembers which form of
    the key was last used to store the entry.  The `keys' and `each'
    functions will return the key that was used to set the value.
